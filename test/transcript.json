    "We'll probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that depressing to you? Seeing that, uh, one turkey kinda taken out of circulation? A turkey you couldn't eat?",

    "Why don't we move on?",
    "Seriously? What's it like for this to be the last time you ever talk to a president?",
    "No. Actually, I think it's a good idea. Uh, if I ran a third time, it'd be sorta like doing a third \"Hangover\" movie. It didn't really work out very well, did it?",
    "Now I have to say that I've seen this show before and, uh, some of the episodes have probably been a little better than this. You know, for example, the one with Bradley Cooper, that was a great show.",
    "He kinda carried that movie, didn't he?",
    "Uh, those \"Hangover\" movies. He, he, basically, he carried them.",
    "Good lookin' guy.",

    "Zach, that's a ridiculous question.",
    "Where's your birth certificate? Why, why don't you show it to us right now?",
